Opal-0.4 (June 2019)
-----------
1. Depolarization added. Now, you can use arbitrary and different linear polarizations for transmitters and receivers. It also allows to simulate leaning (non horizontal or vertical) walls. It also has a performance cost, 
so it can be enabled or disabled. Polarization programas are in their own folder.
2. Multi-device. Multiple GPUs can be used seamlessly. In fact, the Optix context manages them automatically. Some minor changes have been done to support this. 
3. Add a different different payload type. Now we have the HVWavePayload for the default mode with vertical or horizontal polarization and a LPWavePayload for arbitrary linear polarizations. In both cases, 
the fields have been packed as suggested in the documentation to improve the performance.  



Opal-0.3 (April 2019) 
-----------
1. Penetration added. Now rays can penetrate environment elements. Penetration uses recursive tracing and incurs in a performance penalty, so it 
can be enabled or disabled. A transmission coefficient plus an independent material attenuation are aplied to the rays. 
  - MaterialEMProperties has been updated to support attenuation.

2. Merged single and multitransmitter launches. Now all launches are 3D, with the z dimension used for the number of transmitters. A single 
transmitter sets z=1 (as used in OMNET). Code is cleaner and it should also improve performance (see https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1048952/optix/recompile-question/ about setting variables vs buffer).
 - Removed all single/multi* .cu files, since we do not distinguish any more.
 - HitInfo now includes the transmitter buffer index and is sorted according to the transmitter

 3. Changed callable programs to device functions. According to https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1048990/optix/question-about-function-vs-callable-programs/ 
 callable programs are necessary if we need virtual function like functionality, which we don't at the moment. Complex arithmetic has been put in its own Complex.h

 4. Tests have been moved along with main() to a tests.cpp file.

Opal-0.2 (March 2019)
-----------
1. Multi-transmitter: you can now launch with multiple transmitters in parallel. They are supposed to transmit simultaneously. No interference is computed, the receivers get the power received by each transmitter separately.  
To use it, a new class has been derived from the Opal class, since 
this feature is not compatible with OMNET++  at the moment.
